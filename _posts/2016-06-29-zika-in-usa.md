title: Expansion of mosquito distribution may soon be followed by tropical disease
---

The <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito can be found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, transmitting several tropical diseases, such as the recent Zika virus epidemic in Brazil.

Last year however, a [study](http://www.ajtmh.org/content/94/1/231) pointed that the mosquito population is adapting to cooler climates and spreading towards northern regions. They found genetic evidence of mosquitoes over-wintering in Washington, D.C. at least for the past 4 years, most likely taking underground refugia.
In the following Spring, Zika cases started being reported in the region and nearby states although all were travel-associated. However as the mosquito population becomes active as Summer approach, the risk from transmission within the USA rises.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has recently published a [risk map](https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/news/19850/potential-zika-virus-risk-estimated-for-50-us-cities) for Zika epidemics based on passenger air flux from countries on the CDC Zika travel information list and the distribution of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito populations.
Overall, the need to further implement effective control measures urge with the eminent threat of Zika in northern regions, as the vector adapts to new environments.
