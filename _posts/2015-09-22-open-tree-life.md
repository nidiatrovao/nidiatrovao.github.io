title: The open tree of life
---

All organisms on Earth are in some way related to each other, but uncovering these evolutionary relationships can be a daunting task not only because there are more than 1.8 million species, but only around 20% of them are sequenced and publicly available.

In a recent [paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/09/16/1423041112.long), scientist developed an efficient and automated process for assembling tens of thousands of evolutionary trees constructed with gene sequences and morphological data, into a complete tree of life. This open tree of life presents the relationships of more than 2.3 million cellular organisms to have a most recent common ancestor roughly at [3.5 billion years ago](https://today.duke.edu/2015/09/treeoflife).

Although this synthetic tree of life assumes a bifurcating topology, some relationships, specially those that arose from hybridisation among green plant clades and animal lineages, horizontal gene transfer in bateria and archae or recombination, are more accurately described using reticulating networks. The graphical approach used here allows annotation of such reticulate event, however additional methods and metadata are needed to resolve such conflicts.

This project presents as an open source framework that allows continuous update of the tree of life as new organisms are characterised and new data gets published.
