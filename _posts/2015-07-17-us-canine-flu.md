title: Canine Influenza Virus in the USA
---
From the three genera of Influenza virus (A, B and C) most attention is focused on the Influenza A and B viruses mainly because of their public health and economic impact, specially on humans and livestock animals.

Recently however, dogs in Chicago, USA have been affected by canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 - not to be confused with the seasonal human flu H3N2 -, a mutated avian virus that was first reported in dogs in South Korea in 2007.
This upper respiratory tract infection is highly contagious and potentially deadly in these animals. It has cause several thousands of confirmed cases and hit at least 19 states.

In the world of cross-species transmission, there was a laboratory-confirmed report of the first cat in the USA diagnosed with CIV H3N2.
There are no human cases reported, but since the virus has already evolved from infecting birds to dogs and cats, there is no guarantee that this epidemic can't soon turn into an emergent zoonotic disease. Combine the high infectious profile of the virus with the globally connected human society, and the situation could quickly escalate towards a pandemic. For these reasons, surveillance efforts are probably the most important step in disease control.
