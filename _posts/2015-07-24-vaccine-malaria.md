title: EMA approves first malaria vaccine
---

The first malaria vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency to combat the protozoan disease that kills more than 500 thousand people per year worldwide.

Due to the mixed trial results the World Health Organisation and african national health authorities will deliberate later this year on weather to approved the GlaxoSmithKline Mosquirix jab for children in  sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease kills a child every 2 minutes.

Although clinical trials showed highest degree of protection among children aged 17 months to 5 years old, with two thirds of the population being protected from severe malaria, effectiveness of the vaccine depends on administeration of all 4 doses along with a booster, at time intervals not coincident with other childhood vaccination programs which could prove very challenging due to the organisational and monetary effort required.

Anyways, this presents as a very hopefull step towards control of this deadly disease, where even partially protection could play a role on ameliorating the burden in countries with very high prevalence rates.
