title: An important step towards the first malaria vaccine
---

The malaria vaccine candidate Mosquirix&trade; from GlaxoSmithKline&reg; was approved by the European Medicines Agency to combat the protozoan disease that killed more than 584 000 people in 2013 alone.

The African national health authorities and the World Health Organisation will deliberate later this year on whether to approve the vaccine for children in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease kills a child every minute.

Although clinical trials showed highest degree of protection among children aged 5 to 17 months, with two thirds of the population being protected from severe malaria, effectiveness of the vaccine depends on administration of all 4 doses along with an adjuvant, at time intervals not coincident with other childhood vaccination programs, which could prove very challenging to implement, due to the organisational and monetary effort required.

Anyway, this presents as a very hopeful step towards control of this deadly disease, where even partial protection could play a role on ameliorating the burden in countries with very high prevalence rates.
