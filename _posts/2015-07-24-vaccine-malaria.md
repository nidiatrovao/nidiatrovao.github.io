title: EMA approves first malaria vaccine
---

The world's first malaria vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency to combat the protozoan disease that kills more than 500 000 people per year worldwide.

Due to the mixed trial results, the World Health Organisation and African national health authorities will deliberate later this year on whether to approved the GlaxoSmithKline Mosquirix jab for children in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease kills a child every 60 seconds.

Although clinical trials showed highest degree of protection among children aged 17 months to 5 years old, with two thirds of the population being protected from severe malaria, effectiveness of the vaccine depends on administration of all 4 doses along with a booster, at time intervals not coincident with other childhood vaccination programs, which could prove very challenging to implement, due to the organisational and monetary effort required.

Anyways, this presents as a very hopeful step towards control of this deadly disease, where even partially protection could play a role on ameliorating the burden in countries with very high prevalence rates.
