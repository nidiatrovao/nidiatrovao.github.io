title: Will artificial intelligence be the future for better outbreak prediction?
---

Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology (AIME) won this year [Singularity University Global Impact Competition](http://www.genovasi.my/about-designthinking/congratulations-winner-of-sugic-2015) by presenting a prediction platform for detecting future dengue outbreaks. The application uses big data analytics and Bayesian networks to analyze ecological variables such as precipitation, wind direction and speed, thunderstorm, solar radiation, construction sites and temperature [among others](http://nasa.einnews.com/article/257318105/Qygqg0IKOcevqYth?continued=1), to locate outbreaks within a claimed radius of up to 400 meter and as early as 3 months in advance.

With [2.5 billion person at risk](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/dengue/en/), this platform could change the action paradigm from reactive to proactive, enabling better-targeted preventive public health efforts to reduce outbreak's intensity while saving resources and funding for its management.

Although, the platform has been developed for the Malaysian scene with an accuracy of 88.6%, it is yet to be proven if it can be as helpful in other parts of the world burdened by this arbovirosis, and maybe in the future successfully extended to other diseases such as malaria or influenza.
