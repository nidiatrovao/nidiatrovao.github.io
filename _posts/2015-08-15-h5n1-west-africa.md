title: H5N1 outbreak escalates in West Africa
---

Following the West African outbreak of H5N1 reported in my [first post](http://nidiatrovao.com/2015/06/30/h5n1-nigeria/), attempts to control the epidemics have been unfruitful, with countries like Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Libya and now [CÃ´te d'Ivoire](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/14/us-health-bird-flu-idUSKCN0QJ28J20150814) reporting cases of this highly pathogenic avian flu, while increasing the risk of contagion in nearby countries such as Cape Vert.

Very similar to the outbreaks in Asia, live bird markets are playing a important role on facilitating local spread of H5N1.

Such epidemics has caused severe economic impact on a already impoverished population with concerns arising regarding diet alternatives. Additionally, it has increased the awareness of potential transmission to humans.
