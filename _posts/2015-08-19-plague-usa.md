title: USA plagued by the climate
---

Ever thought how cute squirrels are? 

Well think again, because these little fellows are currently transmitting <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, the assumed etiological agent of Black Death pandemics in the late medieval times. More recently, a camping child was infected in Yosemite, California, adding to the six infections of this summer in the USA, with 2 fatal cases.

It is hypothesised that the [cool, wet weather](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/10/3020.full.pdf) of this year, specially in Colorado,  has facilitated increase of the rodent population, namely squirrels and prairie dogs among others, along with the fleas that live on them and transmit these bacteria.

Although plague incidence is limited in the USA, caution has been advised for humans and their pets, with special recommendation of flea repellent treatments when visiting prairie areas.

Although with a fearsome denomination, plague can now be successfully treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early.
