title: Public health efforts sign the beginning of the end of the West Africa Ebola outbreak
---

The most devastating Ebola outbreak in history began in [Guinea in December 2013](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100#t=abstract) and has killed more 11 000 people.
While there is no effective/standardised treatment for this viral infection, demand for a vaccine poses as the main key to alleviate the mortality burden of this and future epidemics.

Fortunately the enormous public health effort on both controlling and improving the livelihoods of the ones affected by Ebola has now done a big step on prevention by developing a [candidate vaccine expressing the suface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus](http://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673615611175.pdf).
Trials in Guinea targeted 7651 adults that were exposed to laboratory confirmed cases and compared disease incidence in both immediate or delayed vaccination clusters. There were no cases of Ebola disease within the immediately vaccinated population, accounting for a estimated vaccine efficacy of 100%, with only 16 cases in the delayed vaccination population.

These results present as a potential tool to protect not only the vaccinated individuals as well as indirectly the unvaccinated population, probably within a week after vaccination.
Hopefully, this newly developed vaccine and ring administering concept will be soon implemented in other countries in West Afica to help curb the Ebola epidemics.
