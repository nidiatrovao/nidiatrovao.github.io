title: The Ebola calamity
---
After being declared Ebola-free in early May, a postmortem test in Liberia came positive for the hemorrhagic fever virus. 
Efforts to unveil the chain of transmission were negative when testing spoiled dog meat that was suspected to be the source of re-introduction. 

The question remains: What is the source of re-emergence? Or has it been circulating there all along?

As a side note, the Portuguese André Carrilho won the [Grand Prix World Press Cartoon 2015](http://www.worldpresscartoon.com/en#/noticias/154) by addressing the Ebola outbreak, exposing the contours of a devastating disease as well as the duality in the media when dealing with the victims.
