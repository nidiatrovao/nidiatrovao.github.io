title: Importance of writing
---
  Besides self-promotion and thought articulation, one of the main goals of this website is a to be a platform where I can practice and somehow log my writing skills.
  Being a PhD student certainly requires a lot of writing, whether you like it or not, you're talented or not. Writing your yearly reports, writing grant applications, writing conference abstracts, writing your lost scribbles to then write your articles, and ultimately writing your thesis. 
  Since I am not the talented type, I will just do as they say and practice. So beware of the posts to come. Off course if you have any suggestions or resources to point me out, please don't hesitate in contacting me!
