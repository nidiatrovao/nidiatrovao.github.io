Despite the virus being present in Europe since the 1950s in local mosquitoes, recently Bulgaria reported the first human case of WNV in Europe. 

Although common symptoms can include fever, body aches and malaise, extreme cases can cause nervous system complications.
With no vaccine or prophylaxis available, this in as alarming public health situation since global warming trends put northern hemisphere countries vulnerable to the emergence of arbovirus diseases.
