title: Host-specific contribution to H5N1 expansion in Eurasia
---

September 2015 granted me my first first-author research article. It targets the intricate host dynamics of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus  (HPAIV) H5N1.

H5N1 is a subtype from the Influenza A genus, and was firstly detected in 1996 in geese of Guangdong, from where it spread globally. 
 
The origins of HPAIV H5N1 are already well characterized, so in this project we wanted to gain insight if genetic data provide information on which host contributes the most for viral spread. Taking into account that H5N1 has a complex ecology involving the host, there are 2 competing hypotheses for these dynamics; 1) Ducks belonging to the <i>Anatidae</i> family are the main contributors for HPAIV H5N1 dispersal in a 2-fold way: 1.1) as domestic asymptomatic carriers, or 1.2) as wild waterfowl, exposing the resident population during their migratory routes; or if 2) chickens belonging to the <i>Phasianidae</i> family perpetuate HPAIV H5N1 epidemics due to the intense movement of poultry products. 
 
From the publicly available samples, we took several measures to mitigate sampling bias, arriving at datasets with 806 sequences of HA and NA from Eurasia, from 1996 till 2011, with location and host annotations.
 
Using the discrete phylogeographic models with BSSVS for the location trait, we demonstrated that the dispersal dynamics can be largely discriminated by two Asian migratory bird flyways, the East Asian-Australasian flyway and the Central Asian flyway. We also estimated an East China network and a central connecting role for Mongolia and North China where these flyways overlap, with westwards movements from Mongolia.
 
Additionally, we wanted to investigate exceptions to the distance-based pattern, I mean identify locations that are further apart but still undergo relatively high viral movement, as characteristic of location visited by wild migratory birds. To this purpose, we extend the recently developed GLM diffusion model to incorporate random effects.
We estimated an exception between Mongolia and North China, including Lake Qinghai, which is an important breeding place for migratory bird species in East Asia, and West Russia and Kazakhstan, including the Siberian lowlands, the largest wetland in the world and an important breeding area for wild birds.
 
To assess the directionality and symmetry in viral host jumps between <i>Anatidae</i> and <i>Phasianidae</i>, we set up four different models and compared them using state-of-the-art model test developed in our lab. We identified a significant degree of host jump asymmetry, with high number of jumps from <i>Anatidae</i> to <i>Phasianidae</i> and high rate of transition form <i>Anatidae</i> to <i>Phasianidae</i>, demonstrating that <i>Anatiadae</i> are the main carriers the epidemics whereas <i>Phasianidae</i> act more as an evolutionary sink.
Simultaneously, we integrated the location trait using the continuous phylogeographic models and estimated the wavefront, diffusivity and dispersal rates, to be higher for Anatidae.
The integration of both host and location in a single analysis and the joint reconstruction of these independent processes, prompted us to develop new visualization approaches that for the first time integrate 3 dimensions - space, time and host - and aim at investigate where the virus was in a particular point in time and in which host, with the challenge being summarizing such realizations. With this we estimated a westward front dominated by <i>Anatidae</i>, which is also dominated by higher dispersal rates.
In conclusion in this study, we now identified Anatidae as the major contributor of HPAIV H5N1 expansion and finally we point out to locations, pathways and the host that should be targeted in surveillance and control efforts.
