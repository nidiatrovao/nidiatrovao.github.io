Welcome!

I created this website to host my work thoughts, endeavours and related analyses of what is going on in the world.

I am a PhD student in the field of Evolutionary Virology in the laboratory of Professor Philippe Lemey at the [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english), Belgium.

My current research goals are directed towards using sequence data to understand patterns in disease transmission, focusing on applying and extending Phylodynamic methods to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of several viral pathogens, with a particular focus on connecting the evolutionary process with geography and ecological patterns of host/vector species, which may prove valuable to investigate the dynamics of many pathogens. 

Before working on Phylodynamics, I earned my Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences from the [Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.ihmt.unl.pt/) in Portugal, where I did the academic program and the KULeuven where I developed my thesis integrated in a project involving the development of a HIV-1 group M near full genome next-generation sequencing protocol, under the supervision of Eng. Bram Vrancken and Professor Philippe Lemey.

During my Bachelor degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the [Universidade Nova de Lisboa](http://www.unl.pt/en/), Portugal, I was a Research fellow in the Centre of Malaria and other Tropical Diseases, Portugal where under the acquisition of resistance to multiple drugs (ARMD) project I successfully defended my thesis on "Phenotyping and genotyping of <i>Plasmodium chabaudi</i> clones resistant to artemisinin and artesunate”, under the supervision of Professor Virgílio do Rosário and Dr. Ana Afonso.
