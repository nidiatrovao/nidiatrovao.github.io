I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow of [Professor Adolfo García-Sastre's laboratory](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/garcia-sastre/) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, USA. Here, I have been part of the [Centers for Excellence in Influenza Research](http://www.niaidceirs.org/), a global research network funded by the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/) at the [National Health Institutes](https://www.nih.gov/), USA. I have also been working closely with [Dr. Martha Nelson](http://misms.net/staff/martha-nelson/) at the [Fogarty International Center](https://www.fic.nih.gov/Pages/Default.aspx), studying the evolution of influenza in animal populations.

I completed my PhD in the field of Evolutionary Virology at the [laboratory of Professor Philippe Lemey](http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv) in [KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english), Belgium. My project integrated the concepts of evolutionary biology and molecular epidemiology to study pathogens' evolutionary processes at different biological scales. This culminated in a doctoral thesis entitled "The genetic traceability of viral pathogens: from isolation by distance to proximity by mobility", and a very particular set of skills that bring together mathemathical modelling through Bayesian statistics and the understanding of fundamental biology processes. These are useful to assess public health threats of viral epidemics and gain insight into patterns in disease transmission, with a particular focus on connecting the evolutionary process with geography and ecological patterns of host/vector species. We were also in a particularly exciting point in time when we aimed at advance phylogeographic inference from a traditionally descriptive approach to a hypothesis testing framework.

Before working on phylodynamics, I earned my Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences from the [Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.ihmt.unl.pt/), Portugal, where I did the academic program, and the [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/english) where I developed my thesis while on an [ERASMUS](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) mobility programme. I was integrated in a project involving the development of a HIV-1 group M full genome next-generation sequencing protocol, under the supervision of [Dr. Bram Vrancken](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/BramVrancken.html) and [Professor Philippe Lemey](https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/lab-members/PhilippeLemey.html).

During my Bachelor degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the [Universidade Nova de Lisboa](http://www.unl.pt/en/), Portugal, I was a Research fellow in the Centre of Malaria and other Tropical Diseases, at the [Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://www.ihmt.unl.pt/) working on the acquisition of resistance to multiple drugs (ARMD) project, under the supervision of Dr. Ana Afonso and Professor Virgílio do Rosário. My specific goals were to phenotype and genotype <i>Plasmodium chabaudi</i> clones resistant to artemisinin and artesunate. This work culminated with the successful defence of my BSc thesis.
