My name is Nídia Sequeira Trovão and I am currently a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/Pages/Default.aspx">Fogarty International Center</a>, and lead the group on <a href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/epidemiology-population-studies/Pages/Genomic-Epidemiology-and-Evolution-of-Pathogens-.aspx">Genomic Epidemiology and Evolution of Pathogens (GEEP)</a>. At GEEP, we study the mechanisms that drive the evolution and spread of pathogens in human and animal populations.  
I am also part of the <a href="http://misms.net/staff/nidia-trovao">Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study</a>, a network that aims to build analytical capacity in genomic epidemiology research through training workshops and hosting visiting researchers, establishing long-term collaborations with scientist globally.
Besides viral respiratory viruses, I also perform phylodynamic modeling of other emergent pathogens, such as norovirus, HIV, and cholera.

For further information or if you are curious to understand how your sequence data are positioned within the evolutionary history of the pathogen and its transmission dynamics, please don’t hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rcptch.html" title="Click to reveal my e-mail address">contact me</a>!
