My name is Nídia Sequeira Trovão and I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow of [Professor Adolfo García-Sastre's laboratory(http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/garcia-sastre/) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, USA. Here, I have been part of the [Centers for Excellence in Influenza Research](http://www.niaidceirs.org/), a global research network funded by the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/) at the [National Health Institutes](https://www.nih.gov/), USA. I have also been working closely with [Dr. Martha Nelson](http://misms.net/staff/martha-nelson/) at the [Fogarty International Center(https://www.fic.nih.gov/Pages/Default.aspx), studying the evolution of influenza in animal populations.
