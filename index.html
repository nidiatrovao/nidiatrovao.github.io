My name is Nídia Sequeira Trovão and I am currently a Postdoctoral Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/Pages/Default.aspx">Fogarty International Center</a>, studying the mechanisms that drive evolution of of viral pathogens in human and animal populations.  
I am also part of the <a href="http://misms.net/staff/nidia-trovao">Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study</a>, a network that aims to build analytical capacity in influenza research by organizing training workshops and hosting visiting guest researchers, establishing long-term collaborations with scientist globally.
Besides influenza, I am also applying phylodynamic principles to other respiratory and zoonotic viruses, such as RSV, rotavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
